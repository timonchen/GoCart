### RETROSPECTIVE reflection before Iteration 3

Prior to starting our last iteration, we met to discuss which parts of our project have not been as successful as we had hoped. The consensus amongst our group was that there was insufficient communication between our members, lack of deadline management, and inconsistency in meeting attendance. 

We decided that in order to better communicate, we all agreed that we needed more frequent communication. To do this, we are going to establish a designated communication channel, where team members are required to post daily updates and engage in regular discussions. Not only will this keep all members accountable, it will allow all members to know our progress instead of hoping for the best. This will also allow us to find issues earlier on than right before the deadline. We will also be able to maintain our expectations throughout the last iteration.

We also had the idea of setting buffer deadlines for this final iteration. This will allow us to finish our work before the last second and allow us to look over our code and make sure everything is up to spec. Our previous two iterations, especially iteration 2, we were extremely rushed when submitting. This led to many errors and smells in our submission. We believe that if we set a deadline 3 days before the actual iteration is due, we will be able to streamline our review process and be more successful in reaching our goals.

The last area of improvement that we plan to improve on is adherence to scheduled meetings. We plan on enforcing guidelines on meeting attendance as well as punctuality. Individuals must notify team members at least 24 hours before a meeting if a member has had something come up or punctuality will be a concern. This will give everyone time to decide on a new meeting and discuss further actions. We also want everyone to be prepared for meetings, which will shorten meeting duration as well as keep the meetings organized. 

To ensure that these areas of improvement can be measurable and objective, we decided to track some indicators for this upcoming iteration. This included, how much work we missed for our buffer deadline. This allows us to better estimate how much to work to realistically estimate for our would-be future iterations. Along with this, we plan to track the daily communication updates. We will strive for 100% for each member but realistically 95% should be fine. We can easily keep track of this and evaluate it at the end of the iteration Another concrete way which we plan on improving is meeting attendance and time tracking. This would be the percentage of time each person attended the meeting as well as how many times they asked to change the meeting. All of these are measurable and objective which we can reflect on for future iterations. Finally, we have our project velocity from the previous two iterations which you can see in our repository.
