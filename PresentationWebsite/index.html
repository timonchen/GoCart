                    By developing GoCart with my team, I was able to develop my skills
                    in developing user interfaces in Android Studio. The specific 
                    skill that I was the most proud of learning and integrating into 
                    GoCart was the recycler view. With my knowledge of recycler view 
                    I was able to easily translate any sorting logic that my team mates
                    created into the user interface. In addition, my knowledge of 
                    recycler view allowed me to represent our objects as cards. 
                    These cards provide a layer of interactivity with each object, and
                    makes the information of each object easier and more appealing to
                    look at as a customer.

                    This project provided me an oppertunity to work on Android App development
                    which is my first experience with the technology. GoCart helped me gain confidence
                    in capability as a dev in my abilities to code a maintainable piece of code. 
                    It was really fun to work on the backend of the app which provided me with a chance
                    to improve my knowldege on HSQLDB and designing the database. Finally, this project
                    helped me to practice agile software development methodology which gave me hands on 
                    experience to the things we studied during the class as an added skill.

                    Testing and Debugging was a large part of what i took away from this project.
                    Ensuring that the app works correctly and efficiently. I gained skills in 
                    testing and debugging, including unit testing, integration testing, and automated
                    testing with espresso. Another proficiency i obtained was in Android development,

                <p>
                    As a team working on GoCart, we learned about how important 
                    communication is to the success of developing a large project. 
                    Working on a team project minimally impacted our growth in 
                    programming, however we learned a lot of lessons about working 
                    with a group. Hence what we will keep doing, stop doing, and 
                    start doing is rooted in communication.

                <p>
                    Our success in each iteration correlated with how much we communicated throughout the month. 
                    In the first iteration, we held meetings frequently. These meetings, although short, allowed us 
                    to gauge each other’s progress. Team members who knew they were behind picked up their phase, 
                    and members who were ahead were known. Members who needed help knew who had extra time to help 
                    them out, and overall, there was less anxiety about the upcoming due date since everyone knew 
                    each other’s progress. Hence holding scheduled meetings weekly is something we would keep doing 
                    if there are future iterations.

                    Contrast that to the second iteration. In the second iteration, 
                    we only started contacting each other around one week prior to 
                    the iteration’s release date. This was mostly due to communication 
                    issues since either one or two people would back out right before 
                    the designated meeting time, which would lead to the cancellation 
                    of a meeting. For a future iteration, we need to stop cancelling 
                    these meetings over just one person missing. We cannot control 
                    the unexpected situations that arise in each other’s lives, and 
                    as a group we should not collapse over just one person missing. 
                    This issue could have been solved easily by just sending the 
                    missing member a message about what was discussed.

                    Throughout the development of each iteration, we noticed that the
                    work of team members trended towards one part of the application. 
                    Members preferred to work on either database, user interface, or 
                    testing, but not more than one of those. We learned that people
                    are unique, and different people specialize at different things.
                    We believe our individual talents 
                    are not being used efficiently by assigning each other features 
                    in isolation. We should be working on features together, focusing 
                    on specialization. The biggest reason that we could not do this 
                    was due to never having a conversation about it. No one was
                    comfortable enough to introduce such a drastic change, and we 
                    did not yet have the trust to entrust each other parts of our 
                    work. But now after three iterations we know what each other 
                    is good at, and if there were a future iteration, we would 
                    focus on specialization over working individually on our 
                    own features. The takeaway here is that in a large project
                    development, different people will specialize in different
                    things. As a group, it is important to figure out early which role
                    best suits a member rather than relying each member to be a jack
                    of all trades.

                    How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) 
                    vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted? 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    For the most part, we were able to deliver most of the features 
                    we initially proposed in iteration 0. We encountered some hiccups 
                    in iteration 2. Part of it was due to the last day crunch, and 
                    the other was due to the features in this iteration being too 
                    big. This led to user stories being removed from the feature 
                    “Create user accounts”. The user stories we cut did not have a 
                    huge effect on our vision since they were mostly quality of life 
                    changes and can easily be reintroduced in a later iteration on a 
                    separate feature. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also concluded that our vision for the project has been 
                    satisfied for iteration 3. The main and unique functionality 
                    that we promised, which is finding the cheapest order, has been 
                    fully implemented. After the completion of that feature, we were 
                    confident and fully committed to the vision.
