# GoCart Vision Statement

GoCart will be used for sourcing the cheapest possible grocery order from all available stores in the vicinity, as well as being used to place an order at any nearby grocery stores. Like InstaCart customers will be able to shop normally at whichever available store of their choosing.

The system is primarily designed for people who are looking for convenience. That is the convenience of not actually having to physically go to the store, but also not having to find the best prices. It will allow the shoppers to either choose a store and order from there or just pick the products they want and let the app find and compare all the products and choose the store with the cheapest overall price for the order.

The system will also be used by people who have some sort of physical limitations. Whether that be a disability or age-related issues. With their restrictions, the ability to conduct their grocery shopping online will be of extreme value to them.
Along with people looking for convenience, employees of the grocery stores will be able to use the system. This will be to add products, change prices or put on deals that the store is offering. The employees will also be able to reach out to customer service if they are experiencing any issues with the system.

Currently the system is planned as an android application. This would further be extended into an IOS application as well as having a full website with the same functionality.

While InstaCart is similar in that it allows for people to order groceries from stores, GoCart extends this functionality to actual source the cheapest prices possible. With this, the time the shoppers need to find the best prices will be reduced. The grocery stores will also be able to attract more customers using this feature by beating out their competitors' prices. This will drive sales and increase word of mouth about the savings at these stores which will increase their client base for both people using the application and people who are just regular shoppers.

The project will be a success if the various types of users save 10% on their grocery bills over a six month using the system versus their normal shopping pattern as well as if they save time using this system over other systems available on the market as determined by a survey.
